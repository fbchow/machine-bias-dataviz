        How accurate is software used to predict future criminals?<br/><br/>And is it biased against certain groups?

        <div class="title">ProPublic</div>
        <i>Angwin et al. (2016)</i>, reporters from the non-profit journalism organization, set out to assess one of the popular commercial tools COMPAS to discover the underlying accuracy of their recidivism algorithm and to test whether the algorithm was biased against certain groups.

        Here are all 5,040 words of my talk.

        <div class="title">Sampled</div>
        5,000 black defendants and 5,000 white defendants were included in the sample from Breward County.

        <div class="title">Um's, Ah's &amp; Uh's</div>
        I almost exclusively used these three fillers. Um's and Ah's made up over 80%, with Uh's trailing behind.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">Fillers Over Time</div>
        I hoped that all these blunders were toward the beginning of my talk. And the data suggests that fewer fillers are used as I get into it. Perhaps the talk started out rough and improved as I found my groove.

        <div class="title">Overall Distribution of Risk Assesment Scores</div>
        After people are booked at jail, they take the risk assessment survey and are given a pretrial risk assesment score. <br><br> 1 = low risk and 10 = high risk.<br><br>
        Some judges use the score to inform who they release earlier from jail or the amount of bail they assign a defendant. Some judges don't use the score at all.

      <section class="step">
        <div class="title">The Cough Effect</div>
        My theory is that at this critical halfway point in my talk, I heard a dry cough indicative of the audience's waning interest. This caused self-confidence to collapse and forced me out of my groove.<br/><br/>A competing theory is that I just hadn't practiced the last half of my speech as much.

        The world may never know, or care, but hopefully these insights improve my speaking in 2015. Though preliminary results aren't looking so good.
